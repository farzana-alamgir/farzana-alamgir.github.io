  -Oil Price Uncertainty and Sovereign Default
  
Abstract
Oil price fluctuations are a major source of instability in the global economic condition. Numerous studies have linked sovereign default risk to global factors such as US monetary policy, risk appetite, global liquidity and contagion from systemic events. Moreover, since most of the sovereign bond issuers in emerging markets are either important crude oil exporters or importers, oil price fluctuations may convincingly seem to be an important determinant in explaining sovereign default risk. The impact of oil price volatility on sovereign risk is likely to differ based on whether a country is a net-exporter or net-importer of crude oil. In this paper I focus my analysis to emerging economies that are net importers of oil and seek to investigate how oil price volatility shocks may affect the sovereign spread in such countries. In order to estimate oil price uncertainty, the price of oil is modeled to evolve according to a stochastic volatility process and the stochastic volatilities are estimated by a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Based on a sample of 35 emerging economies whose economic development prospect relies significantly on energy-intensive activities, I show that shocks to oil price as well as volatility of oil price play a significant role in determining sovereign bond spreads. Next the canonical sovereign default model is extended for a small economy that imports oil as a factor of production. By introducing stochastic volatility framework in the price of oil, it is shown that the sovereign spread is highly dependent on the level and volatility states of oil price in an oil-importing economy.
