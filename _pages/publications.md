### Job Market Paper
 
##### Oil Price Uncertainty and Sovereign Default
 
**Abstract:** 
 
Oil price fluctuations are a significant source of instability in the global economic condition. Numerous studies have linked sovereign default risk to global factors such as US monetary policy, risk appetite, global liquidity, and contagion from systemic events. In this paper, I focus my analysis on emerging economies that are net importers of oil and seek to investigate how oil price volatility shocks may affect the sovereign spread in such countries. To estimate oil price uncertainty, the price of oil is modeled to evolve according to a stochastic volatility process, and the stochastic volatilities are estimated by a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Based on a sample of 35 emerging economies whose economic development prospect relies significantly on energy-intensive activities, I show that shocks to oil prices and volatility of oil prices play a significant role in determining sovereign bond spreads.  Next, the canonical sovereign default model is extended for a small economy that imports oil as an input to their domestic production. By introducing a stochastic volatility framework in the price of oil, it is shown that the sovereign spread is highly dependent on the level and volatility states of oil prices in an oil-importing economy.
